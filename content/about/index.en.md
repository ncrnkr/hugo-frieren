## Who is Frieren?

Frieren is an elven mage over a thousand years old who once defeated the Demon King alongside the hero Himmel, the priest Heiter, and the warrior Eisen. After their decade-long journey ended, the group parted ways – and it was only decades later that Frieren realized how little she had appreciated the time spent with her companions.

## Her New Journey

Driven by the desire to better understand humans, Frieren embarks on a new journey – accompanied by her apprentice Fern and the young warrior Stark. Their destination: Ende, the holy city where the souls of the departed are said to rest.

## Philosophy

> "Humans live such short lives, and yet they manage to fill those few years with so much meaning."

On her journey, Frieren learns that the seemingly insignificant moments – a shared meal, a sunset, a smile – are life's true treasures.

## What Defines Her

- **Master Mage** – One of the most powerful mages in her world
- **Collector** – Loves gathering curious and useless spells
- **Immortal** – Over a thousand years old, but still learning at heart
- **Mentor** – Lovingly passing her knowledge on to Fern
