The legendary journey that started it all – ten years, four heroes, one goal.

## The Mission

The hero party led by Himmel set out to defeat the Demon King and liberate the continent. What began as a classic hero's quest became a story about friendship and the meaning of shared time.

## The Challenges

- Battles against the Seven Great Demons
- Crossing the northern continent
- Overcoming magical barriers
- Uniting different peoples

## The Legacy

Victory over the Demon King brought peace, but the true treasure of the journey was the memories made along the way.
