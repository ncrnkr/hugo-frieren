The hero party led by Himmel is the heart of Frieren's story. Four completely different personalities, united by a common goal.

## Himmel – The Hero

Himmel wasn't a typical hero. He wasn't the strongest or the smartest, but he was the one who held everyone together. His true strength lay in his heart and his ability to see the best in others.

> "A true hero is someone who understands the feelings of others."

## Heiter – The Priest

Heiter was the drink-loving priest of the group. Behind his easygoing nature lay a deep faith and great wisdom. He was the one who took in and raised Fern.

## Eisen – The Warrior

The dwarf warrior Eisen was the raw power of the group. Despite his tough exterior, he had a soft heart – especially when it came to his companions. He later became Stark's mentor.

## Frieren – The Mage

Frieren herself was the party's mage. For her, the ten years of their journey passed in the blink of an eye – only later did she realize those years were the most precious of her long life.

## Conclusion

What makes the hero party special isn't their strength in battle, but the bonds that connect them.
