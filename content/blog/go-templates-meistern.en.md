After Himmel's death, Frieren embarks on a new journey – this time with two young companions who change her in unexpected ways.

## Fern – The Apprentice

Fern is Frieren's apprentice and an exceptionally talented mage. Raised by Heiter, she is disciplined, caring, and sometimes stern with Frieren – almost like a mother.

> "Frieren, you need to eat more. And no, you can't sleep for three days straight."

Fern reminds Frieren what it means to nurture human connections. She is the compass that anchors Frieren in the present.

## Stark – The Warrior

Stark is Eisen's former student and despite his enormous strength, a fearful young man. His greatest challenge isn't battle, but his self-confidence.

The dynamic between Stark and Fern brings a warmhearted, sometimes comical note to the journey – showing that the new generation has its own kind of heroism.

## The Parallels

The new group mirrors the old hero party in fascinating ways:

- **Frieren** remains the mage, but this time as a mentor rather than a distant companion
- **Fern** carries traits of Heiter – caring and wise beyond her years
- **Stark** resembles Eisen – physically strong, emotionally vulnerable

## Conclusion

Through Fern and Stark, Frieren learns what Himmel wanted to teach her: that the people who accompany us matter more than the destination.
